theforeman.foreman.cp_label filter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The documentation for the filter plugin, theforeman.foreman.cp_label,  was malformed.

The errors were:

* ::

        Missing documentation or could not parse documentation: No documentation available for theforeman.foreman.cp_label (/home/runner/work/foreman-ansible-modules/foreman-ansible-modules/build/collections/ansible_collections/theforeman/foreman/plugins/filter/foreman.py)


File a bug with the `theforeman.foreman collection <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules/issues>`_ in order to have it corrected.
